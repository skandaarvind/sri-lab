					<h2>Waterloo Researchers Awarded $3.9 Million to Partner with Industry</h2>
					<!-- <img src="Images/News/UW_BridgeDamper_Husky-Clearpath.jpg" alt="Team with clearpath husky" style="max-width:100%;" /> -->
					<p>Waterloo - Seven researchers at the University of Waterloo are receiving more than $3.9 million to collaborate with Canadian-based companies and government organizations on strategic research projects. The funding for Strategic Partnership Grants announced today by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) helps bring expertise from academia and industry together to collaborate on research that will lead to innovation and commercialization. Waterloo has a long history and reputation for successful industry partnerships, and was ranked second in Canada for collaboration with industry by the CWTS Leiden Ranking 2015.</p>

					<h2>MAKE-A-BRIDGE in University of Waterloo Vibration Study</h2>
					<!-- <img src="Images/News/UW_BridgeDamper_Husky-Clearpath.jpg" alt="Team with clearpath husky" style="max-width:100%;" /> -->
					<p>July 28, 2014—MONTREAL, CANADA – Make-A-Bridge®, the weld-free aluminum pedestrian bridge was chosen for use in a comprehensive vibration testing and analysis research study conducted at the University of Waterloo by engineering Professors Scott Walbridge, Ph.D., and Sriram Narasimhan, Ph.D.  The Make-A-Bridge specimen given to the University by the engineering firm MAADI Group, Inc., Montréal, allows easy span variation from 10ft (3m) to 70ft (21m) in overall length.  Extensive laboratory tests were performed on vibrations resulting from crowd loading the structure with up to 30 people, and recording vibrations’ effects on the bridge’s key joints and on its structural integrity, measuring acceleration responses for different bridge spans.  The Make-A-Bridge® was selected for its modular design that enabled easy changing of the bridge’s length.</p>

					<h2>MAADI Group Pedestrain Bridge in Vibration Study</h2>
					<!-- <img src="Images/News/UW_BridgeDamper_Husky-Clearpath.jpg" alt="Team with clearpath husky" style="max-width:100%;" /> -->
					<p>The MAADI Group engineering firm, Montréal, Québec, has had their 145-foot-long Brossard, Quebec aluminum pedestrian bridge chosen for a footbridge vibration study by Professors Scott Walbridge and Sriram Narasimhan and their team at the University of Waterloo’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The aluminum pedestrian bridge, which spans Daigneault Creek, was chosen for this field study on vibration effects because it is the longest footbridge of its kind in Canada, it is located near a major center, and the bridge offers good access to its underside across its entire length.
					The vibration research study was conducted by Professors Walbridge and Narasimhan, with lab technician Richard Morrison and graduate students Ann Sychterz, Pampa Dey, and Ayan Sadhu in Fall 2012.</p>
